# CoL New Antagonist: Insurgence Clan

## *With so many different antagonists that are in CoL and each of them filling out a niche like mafia RP or Quest givers, why not make a new original antagonist which fills out a niche of grouping players up? The Insurgence Clan, based on the ████████ ████, are able to produce custom augments like the prosthetic surgeon, and for much cheaper. Yet, they come with a special downside which if not managed by grouping up with other players.*

## Roles

The Insurgence Clan consists of 4 Transport Agents and 1 Nightwatch Agent.

### Transport Agent

**Stats**  
*60, 60, 60, 60*

**Weapon 1**  
*40 BLACK*  
*1.25 attack speed*  
*Inflicts 2 tremor on hit and tremor bursts when hitting a target with 40+ tremor.*

**Weapon 2**  
*5 BLACK*  
*1.25 attack speed*  
*A 40, 30, 30, 20 sheild that can be alt, clicked to reduce it's size. Also, when it is attacked by Weapon 1 it will emit an intimidating sound*

**Armor**  
*RED 10, WHITE 40, BLACK 40, PALE = 0*

### Nightwatch Agent

**Stats**  
*100, 100, 100, 100*

**Weapon**  
*49 BLACK*  
*0.75 attack speed*  
*On hit, if the target has 15+ tremor, tremor burst twice (Has a cooldown of 20 seconds) If the target is over 50% HP, deal 20% more damage.*

**Armor**
*RED 40, WHITE 70, BLACK 70, PALE = 30*

*If a nightwatch agent is wearing this armor, they gain a special action called “cloak”. (This weapon checks the mind of the user, such as if ((user?.mind? assigned_role in 'nightwatch')))*  
*When they use cloak, over the course of 5 seconds they will become fully invisible, lose density, and mobs will become unable to attack them. However, they will deal 50% less damage with their attacks. Once they attack or use their action again, they will lose their invisibility over the course of 2 seconds.*

## Objective

### Custom Augments

The Insurgence Clan will be able to fabricate custom augments like the prosthetics surgeon and sell them to players in the city, (Look over here for more info about custom augments: [Guide to Custom Augments](https://wiki.lc13.net/view/Guide_to_Custom_Augments_\(Work_in_Progress\))) They will have a massive discount on all of their effects and the attribute requirements for all ranks is reduced by 20\. However, those augments will have a special component called ***Mental Corrosion***.

**Mental Corrosion**  
*Mental Corrosion is a value that starts out at 0, and slowly grows every 2 minutes. However, you are able to slow down the speed at which Mental Corrosion grows by staying near other living humans. Also, if you stay near some specific humans more than others. Those humans will be marked as “Bonds” and staying near “Bonds” will reduce Mental Corrosion instead of just slowing it down. (The augment user is not told who their “Bonds” are, and they can only have a max of 3 Bonds.)*   
*However, when Augments user is near the Insurgence Clan members, they will speed up the Mental Corrosion instead of slowing it down.*

*Time to reach 100% Mental Corrosion if the user avoids all humans: 20 minutes*

*Then higher the users Mental Corrosion, then more strange events will happen around them…*

***From 0-19%,** Nothing special happens to them.*  
***From 20% and higher…** They will start hearing a voice from ████████, with it getting more frequent then higher their Mental Corrosion is.*  
***From 60% and higher…** The voice will start suggesting them to jump into the great lake.*  
***75% and higher…** Your vision will slowly become worse, with everything becoming darker as the Mental Corrosion further rises.*  
***90% and higher**, when you panic, your panic type will always wander, and you will try to jump into the great lake.*

(When the above text says 'The Great Lake', it means any /turf/open/water/deep in ModularTegustation\fishing\code\turfs.dm)

The Insurgence Clan will have a console in their base which will let them track all of the users of their augments. From there, they will be able to see their health, location, mental corrosion level, and their “Bonds.”

### Managing Corrosion

The Insurgence Clan is tasked with distributing their augments, and trying to get their users to reach at least **60%** Mental Corrosion. Should it be by trying to isolate them or trying to act as bodyguards for them, anything is on the table. Once they reach **60%** Mental Corrosion, their next job is to start convincing them to jump into the lake willingly. However, if they jump in willingly and reach **80%** mental corrosion, all of the Insurgence Clan members will be notified of them reaching **80%** and will get permission to kidnap them. IMPORTANT NOTE, they need to kidnap them alive since they need to be alive when they are thrown into the lake.

Once they are thrown into the lake, the Insurgence Clan job is done, and they need to move on to the next human. While for the human that got thrown in…

### Conversion Event

Whether the Insurgence Clan Augment user enters the lake willing or not at 60% or more… They are then transported to a new Z-Level, and will gain a special status effect. In this new Z-Level, they will be able to encounter ████████ waiting for them. As long as they have the status effect, they will be unable to harm ████████ nor leave this place, as they will be instantly teleported back if they are somehow teleported out of there.

They will be able to talk with ████████ for a brief while, before they will need to accept the Conversion. Once they accept it, a small cutscene will play out where they are transformed into a simple mob, who will then be thrown back into the city.

### RP Goals

* Purify the humans, break their humanity…  
* Save the humans from their own hubris, save them from the city with your enlightenment.   
* Show them the cruelty of humanity, make them accept the order of machine…  
    
* “For the Order of the Elder one…”
